	sudo npm install -g create-react-app
	
	If this error comes (Error: "Error: SSL Error: SELF_SIGNED_CERT_IN_CHAIN")

	npm config set prefix /usr/local //set prefix if giving error on above command and again rerun it
	sudo apt-get install nodejs-legacy // if you have alredy have it then no need to install npm
	create-react-app my-app
